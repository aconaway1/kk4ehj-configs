A repo for keeping ham radio configurations.  We'll start with different Direwolf configs for different scenarios, but we'll go on from there, I'm sure.
# The Basic Setup
* Raspberry Pi 3B+
* USB sound card (either a Pluggable or uGreen that use the C-Media chip)
* Custom interface cables (just some wire, connectors, and solder...nothing fancy)
* Yaesu FT-1900 and FT-2800 radios
** Same plugs and pinouts

#  Some of the working config files
There may be quite a few files in the config directory, but these are actually working. Yes, I know I need to learn what branches are.  :)

* **direwolf.conf-aprsbeacon-gpsd-simple** : This queries a remote GPSD server for location and configured direwolf to act like a tracker.
